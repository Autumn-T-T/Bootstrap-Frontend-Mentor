# Frontend Mentor – QR Code Component

## Overview
This project is an implementation of the Frontend Mentor **QR Code Component** challenge using Bootstrap. The goal was to accurately recreate the provided Figma design while ensuring responsiveness.

## Approach
I used Bootstrap’s grid system to center the content and Bootstrap’s card component for structure. Utility classes were used for spacing and typography, with minimal custom CSS added to match the design.

## Challenges
One challenge was matching the spacing and proportions of the design. I addressed this by adjusting Bootstrap utility classes and testing the layout across different screen sizes.

## Improvements
With more time, I would further refine spacing details and test across additional devices and browsers.
